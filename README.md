    <h2>the story in the book-versoin 2</h2>
    
    <h4>chapter 2</h4>
    
    <hr>   
    
    <pre>Molly had been staring out of her window for about an hour now. On her desk, lying between the copies of Nature,
New Scientist, and all the other <del>scientific journals</del> her work had appeared in, was a well-thumbed copy of<i> On the Road</i>.
It had been Molly's favorite book since <i>college</i>, and the longer she spent in these four walls the more she felt she
needed to be free.
She had spent the <mark>last ten years</mark> in this room, sitting under a poster with an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oscar_Wilde" title="sir oscar wilde">Oscar Wilde</a> quote proclaiming that Work
is the refuge of people who have nothing better to do. Although many considered her pioneering work, unraveling the
secrets of the llama <mark>DNA</mark>, to be an outstanding achievement, Molly did think she had something better to do.
